/**
 * Fortunately, Akka Testkit comes with the TestActorRef class.
 * When you create an Actor with the TestActorRef, it will use a special message dispatcher called
 * CallingThreadDispatcher that will execute the actor receive() method in the same thread it has been sent.
 * Therefore, all your tell() calls will become synchronous and more easily testable.
 *
 * In addition to making the actor message processing synchronous, the TestActorRef will give back a special
 * ActorRef instance that allows you to access the underlying actor instance
 * (which is not possible with standard Akka actors).
 * It allows you to make assertions about some of the actorâ€™s internal states.
