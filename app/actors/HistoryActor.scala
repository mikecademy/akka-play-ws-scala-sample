 Both the WriterActor and the ReaderActors are controlled by a "manager actor".

 This topÂ­level actor
  - delegates messages to the WriterActor when needed
  - spawns, maintains and forwards messages to ReaderActors.

  This top level 'manager actor' represents the entry point to the History library.
